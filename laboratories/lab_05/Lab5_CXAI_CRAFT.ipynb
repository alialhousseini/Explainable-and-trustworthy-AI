        "\n",
        "1. **Input images selection**: Select a set of images ***X*** from the dataset where the model's predictions align with the class under investigation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Layer Selection**: Choose a layer to initiate the investigation, and split the model into 2 parts at this location: the 1st part ***g*** computes the activations of our input images, while the 2nd part ***h*** computes the logits.<br> **CRAFT will extract concepts from the activation space of this selected layer.**\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **CRAFT Fitting**:\n",
        " * **Crops Extraction**: CRAFT automatically **extracts random image crops** from the input dataset. This choice is motivated by the expectation that concepts are present in these crops, and can be subsequently dissected. CRAFT will operate on these crops to factorize the concepts. These crops are also used to visualize the concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        " * **Concept Activation Factorization**: In this phase, we use the 1st model ***g*** to compute the random crops activations, and then apply a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to decompose these positive activations into two matrices:\n",
        "  >* W constitutes a dictionary of Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs). It can be understood as a \"concept basis\" or \"concept bank\",\n",

        "\n",
        "  * **In general**, the **Sensitivity** measures the degree to which a model's output or predictions are influenced by changes or perturbations in specific features or concepts.\n",
